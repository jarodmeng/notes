# GNU make

## Introduction

You need a file called *makefile* to tell `make` what to do. Most often, the
makefile tells `make` how to *compile* and *link* a program.

The makefile can also tell `make` how to run miscellaneous commands when
explicitly asked (e.g., to remove certain files as a clean-up operation).

### What a rule looks like

A simple makefile consists of "rules" with the following shape:

```
target ... : prerequisites ...
        recipe
        ...
        ...
```

A **target** is usually the name of a file that's generated by a program;
examples are executable or object files. A target can also be the name of an
*action* to carry out, such as `clean`.

A **prerequisite** is a file that is used as input to create the target. A
target often depends on several files.

A **recipe** is an action that `make` carries out. A recipe might have more than
one command, either on the same line or each on its own. **Note: you need to put
a tab character at the beginning of every recipe line.**

A **rule** explains how and when to remake certain files which are the
targets of the particular rule. `make` carries out the recipe actions on the
prerequisites to create or update the target.
